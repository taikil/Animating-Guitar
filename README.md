# Animating Guitar Project

This project aims to simulate realistic guitar playing through lifelike hand motions using Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK).

## Overview

The "Animating Guitar" project focuses on accurately simulating the hand movements of a guitar player. The project integrates findings from the Handrix and FABRIK papers and employs a shortest path and cost-minimization algorithm to determine the necessary movements for the fingers, hand, and arm to play inputted notes.

## Abstract

The "Animating Guitar" project aims to simulate realistic guitar playing through lifelike hand motions. Using Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK), the system maps hand positions on a guitar’s strings and frets. The method allows for precise articulation control, optimizing finger placement to reproduce music accurately. Evaluation focuses on the system’s ability to recreate music complexity, from basic melodies to chord sequences.
